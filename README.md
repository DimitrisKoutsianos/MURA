# Abnormality Detection in bone X-Rays

This assignment was part of my Deep Learning Course of the M.Sc. in Data Science program of the Athens University of 
Economics and Business. It was a group assignment with the two other group members being my classmates Despoina Angelonidi
and Panagiota Tavoularea.

Given a study containing X-Ray images, the famous MURA dataset, we were asked to classify these images as either *normal* or *abnormal*. To perform this classification task we followed two distinct directions:
- train on this dataset a CNN with the same architecture as one that performed adequately well on the Fashion-MNIST dataset
- fine tune a number pre-trained CNNs and put them against each other in a competition for which one performs the best
